# SuperM React Tutorial


The project was completed based on hands on project experience from 
https://react-tutorial.app

Feel free to remix the project. You can use it for your job interview, to start your own project. You can add features, remove features, host it online. The only **restriction** is hosting the original project with the instructions that were provided on React Tutorial.

Get started by running `npm install` and then `npm run start`

The app is deployed on my netlify account. Please find the live project [here](https://siddhantsiddh15superm.netlify.app/)

1. useState

7. Component re use
